I should probably be sleeping now, but I'm so moved by the news of Michael Jackson's death that I can't yet.

<!-- more -->
I choked a little when I heard that he had died. Emotion is an uncommon thing for me. My reaction surprised me.

But then I started thinking about the man and what he meant to me. His music was the soundtrack to a large part of my life. I have vivid memories of his work over the years and it feels like a part of my self has died with him.

His life wasn't easy, and he made mistakes, and I think that he was never forgiven for that. Such is life, he had a difficult one.

It was a reminder of my own mortality. Powerful, saddening and unexpected.

He will always be remembered.

Good night, Michael. Sleep well...
