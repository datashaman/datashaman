<a title="Eppelsauce Music" href="http://www.eppelsauce.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Eppelsauce Music</strong></a> is a record label, music agency and recording studio rolled into one. The <a href="http://www.eppelsauce.com/record-label.html" target="_blank">record label</a> specializes in African music from across the continent from traditional <em>Malian</em> and <em>Zimbabwean</em> music to modern <em>Afro Pop</em> and <em>Afro House</em>. All of the albums and artists released by <strong>Eppelsauce Music</strong> are produced in the shadow of Table Mountain in sunny <strong>Cape Town</strong>, <strong>South Africa</strong>.

Founded by performing musician <em>Daniel Eppel</em>, <strong>Eppelsauce Music</strong> strives to create opportunities for African artists without relying on traditional media distribution models, leaving a significantly higher percentage of the royalties to the artists.

Their <a href="http://www.eppelsauce.com/composition.html" target="_blank">composition work</a> includes international commercials, animation, and documentaries for national and international television.

They act as an <a href="http://www.eppelsauce.com/music-agency.html" target="_blank">agency</a> for artists, a state-of-the-art <a href="http://www.eppelsauce.com/recording-studio.html" target="_blank">recording studio</a>; as well as organizing bands, DJs, solo performers and everything in between for any kind of event.

We developed a site to present their artists and albums to interested customers and partners. It also advertises their services to artists looking for an agency with an interest in development and collaboration with the artist.

The template was designed by a business partner, <a href="http://www.cocolure.co.za/" target="_blank">Cocolure</a>, in consultation with the client. I implemented the site using <a title="Typolight" href="http://www.typolight.org/" target="_blank"><em>Typolight</em></a> with the Catalog modules designed by fellow South African company, <a href="http://www.thyon.com/" target="_blank">Thyon Design</a>. The modules extend the functionality of <em>Typolight </em>by allowing the storage of user-defined catalogs of data, making it easy to administer and present the data captured by the client.

For the album detail pages, base functionality and the <em>Metacreator </em>module were too simple for storing information about the downloadable MP3s for the albums. A text file containing metadata about each track supplies the information for the template to deliver an <a href="http://www.eppelsauce.com/album-detail/items/cheza.html">in-browser audio preview</a> for selected tracks.

The player used is <a href="http://www.schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/">Sound Manager 2</a>, which delivers the best quality sound given our throttled South African network structure.

You can <a href="http://www.eppelsauce.com/buy-music-now.html">buy their albums</a> locally at selected outlets in Cape Town, South Africa. Digital downloads from iTunes or online purchase directly from the site should be available soon.

So if you're into African music, <a href="http://www.eppelsauce.com/" target="_blank">check out their site</a>, you'll find something you'll like!
