I've changed the site to <a title="WordPress home page" href="http://www.wordpress.org/" target="_blank">WordPress</a>. It seems to fit better with the type of content I like to send out.

I love it's ease of use. The selection of plugins is amazing, and it's great that there're version compatibility tests for the plugins.

The interface is incredibly well thought out. Everything is optimized for editing.
