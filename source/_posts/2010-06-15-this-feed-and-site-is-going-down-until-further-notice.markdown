It's been fun, but I don't have the time to update the site, and it seems silly to leave it here untended...

> I met a traveller from an antique land  
> Who said: 'Two vast and trunkless legs of stone  
> Stand in the desert. Near them on the sand,  
> Half sunk, a shatter'd visage lies, whose frown  
> And wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command  
> Tell that its sculptor well those passions read  
> Which yet survive, stamp'd on these lifeless things,  
> The hand that mock'd them and the heart that fed.  
> And on the pedestal these words appear:

> > "My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:  
> > Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair!"

> Nothing beside remains: round the decay  
> Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,  
> The lone and level sands stretch far away.  
> <p style="text-align: right;">*Ozymandias, by Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792-1822)*</p>
