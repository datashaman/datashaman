I've decided to at least put something a bit more palatable up in place of the previous site I had. That green was starting to get on my nerves.

I'm now running a WordPress installation, with a slightly tweaked version of the Thematic WordPress Theme.

I'm busy developing a new design for the website, which will come soon...
