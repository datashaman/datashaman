<a href="http://www.cocolure.co.za/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-71" title="Cocolure" src="/images/2009/06/cocolure.jpg" alt="Cocolure" width="236" height="77" /></a>Cocolure chose Data Shaman to construct and integrate the design into the system. The result is a stylish, yet uncomplicated and professional website that showcases exactly what this design studio has to offer.

The main purpose of the site is to provide an easily navigable online <a title="Cocolure's painting gallery" href="http://www.cocolure.co.za/paintings.html" target="_blank">gallery</a> where prospective clients and other interested parties can view Cocolure's portfolio. A <a title="Cocolure's home and biography page" href="http://www.cocolure.co.za/home.html" target="_blank">short biography</a> and <a title="Cocolure's client list" href="http://www.cocolure.co.za/clients.html" target="_blank">client list</a> complement the gallery section.

An important component of <a title="Cocolure" href="http://www.cocolure.co.za/" target="_blank">www.cocolure.co.za</a> has been the ability for Cocolure to maintain the site. Adding or removing content quickly and easily has allowed their client base to be kept up to date on Cocolure's latest projects.

The website has proved a highly useful marketing tool. Cocolure landed two international clients on the strength of the site within a month of launching and looks forward to welcoming even more!
