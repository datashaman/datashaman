Cocolure chose Data Shaman to construct and integrate the design into the system.
The result is a stylish, yet uncomplicated and professional website that
showcases exactly what this design studio has to offer.  

The main purpose of the site is to provide an easily navigable online
[gallery](http://www.cocolure.co.za/paintings.html "Cocolure's paintings galleries")
where prospective clients and other interested parties can view Cocolure's portfolio.

A [short biography](http://www.cocolure.co.za/home.html "Cocolure's home and biography page")
and [client list](http://www.cocolure.co.za/clients.html "Cocolure's client list")
complement the gallery section.

An important component of [www.cocolure.co.za](http://www.cocolure.co.za "http://www.cocolure.co.za/")
has been the ability for Cocolure to maintain the site.

Adding or removing content quickly and easily has allowed their client base to
be kept up to date on Cocolure's latest projects.

The website has proved a highly useful marketing tool. Cocolure landed two
international clients on the strength of the site within a month of launching
and looks forward to welcoming even more!
