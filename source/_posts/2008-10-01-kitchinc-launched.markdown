[![Kitch.Inc](/images/2008/10/kitchinc.gif "Kitch.Inc")](http://www.kitchinc.co.za/ "Kitch.Inc")

is an owner managed business based in Woodstock, Cape Town.
They specialise in the design, manufacture and installation of custom kitchens.
We developed a site showcasing their creations, and opening avenues for new business.

<!-- more -->
The site was developed using [Typolight](http://www.typolight.org/ "Typolight"),
hosted under my account on [Media Temple](http://www.mediatemple.net/ "Media Temple").

The site leverages much of the functionality of the CMS to produce a dynamic
editable site-structure, with easy WYSIWYG editing of content.

The gallery component renders all files in a defined folder. Metadata can
easily be added to render as captions under each image.

The contact form stores all contacts in the database, and checks the humanity
of the entry with a simple maths question.

The site owner is happy that he now has a showcase for his wares, widening
communications and extracting more value from the Internet medium.
