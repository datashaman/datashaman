The site was developed using <a title="Typolight" onclick="window.open(this.href); return false;" href="http://www.typolight.org/" target="_blank">Typolight</a>, hosted under my account on <a title="Media Temple" onclick="window.open(this.href); return false;" href="http://www.mediatemple.net/" target="_blank">Media Temple</a>.

The site leverages much of the functionality of the CMS to produce a dynamic editable site-structure, with easy WYSIWYG editing of content.

The gallery component renders all files in a defined folder. Metadata can easily be added to render as captions under each image.

The contact form stores all contacts in the database, and checks the humanity of the entry with a simple maths question.

The site owner is happy that he now has a showcase for his wares, widening communications and extracting more value from the Internet medium.
