As soon as I saw the posting about <a title="Twittorati" href="http://twittorati.com/" target="_blank">Twittorati</a> launching soon, I logged on to have a look.

Here's a snapshot of the home page.

Firstly, hasn't Twitter recently started making noises about the use of the term Twitter within product names? Being forced to change the name post-launch could be very embarrassing.

Nice big links for everything. Not so sure they've got the navigation right though.  If you click on the first link, Tweets, it takes you to the home page, titled: 'Top Blogs on Twitter'. Doesn't seem like there's an intuitive match between link and title there.

They're trying to blur the line between Twitter and blogs, to maximize any influence they have from the existing Technorati platform, I'd say. Clever move. But I'm not so sure that Technorati has as much influence as it used to have.

Everything is a subset of what you'd find on Twitter. The trending hashtags are for the top 100 bloggers only. The trending Technorati tags are from the top 100 bloggers only.

The search function on the site will show you only results from their top 100 Twitterati. They only list the top 100. Only show blog posts from the top 100.

Sorry, <a title="Scobleizer on friendfeed" href="http://friendfeed.com/scobleizer" target="_blank">scobleizer</a>! ;-)

The Latest Photos link shows you the latest photos from the top 100 bloggers.

I don't think this will be all that successful. Visiting the site is like going to a club and being denied entrance because it's for VIPs only.

Or reading (an admittedly more intelligent) Heat magazine, where you get to see what the famous and oh-so popular are up to and into.

It's an isolationary move, it's an exclusive move, and I don't like it, personally.

IMO, if I wanted to use the site for anything it would be to find out what's popular in my area of interest. But I'd do that once, maybe twice, subscribe to the suggested blog and/or Twitter feed and probably not come back.

There are so many ranking sites out there, listing people's influence on Twitter. Technorati lists blogs by their own influence algorithm, which they're leveraging on this site. Real-time search engines are to be found in many forms all over the web.

Perhaps I'm stupid, but when I first logged on, I went straight to the search, entered my own twitter account name and came up with nothing (obviously).

After browsing around it dawned on me that this site was for the elite only, and I was disappointed. Yet another club I can't join...

The tagline for the site is inappropriate in this respect:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Where the blogosphere and twittersphere meet</p>

should read:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Where the blogosphere and twittersphere of the top 100 bloggers meet</p>

or:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Where the snobosphere and twittersphere meet (I like this one)</p>
